Notes on which runs have problems in reported detected frame (if no notes then has not been inspected)
AmBe B0 - 8 bit,4, CODE IS RIGHT
AmBe B0 - 8 bit,16, CODE IS RIGHT
AmBe B1 - 8 bit,3, *** DISREGARD ALL AmBe B1 ***
AmBe B1 - 8 bit,4, *** DISREGARD ALL AmBe B1 ***
AmBe B1 - 8 bit,8, *** DISREGARD ALL AmBe B1 ***
AmBe B1 - 8 bit,12, *** DISREGARD ALL AmBe B1 ***
AmBe B1 - 8 bit,14, *** DISREGARD ALL AmBe B1 ***
AmBe B1 - 8 bit,17, *** DISREGARD ALL AmBe B1 ***
AmBe C0 - 8 bit,23, this is far too low quality to reasonably be able to get correct - disregard
AmBe top A - 8 bit,25, CODE IS RIGHT
control 01 - 8bit for sub,3 CODE IS RIGHT
control 01 - 8bit for sub,17, check 14/15 visually? CODE IS RIGHT FOR ALL 3
control 02 - 8 bit,5, quality too low - disregard
control 06 - 8 bit,40, CODE IS RIGHT
control 07 - 8 bit,12, check 30-50 visually? 12 - this is supposed to be 196, just resorting no detection to frame 200 will fix this. 30-50 are OK, normalization explains discrepancy between code and answer key
control 09 - 8 bit,4, quality too low - disregard
control 10 - 8 bit,6, THIS IS SIGNIFICANT? I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE CODE FAILS ON THIS EVENT - THERE IS HOWEVER SIGNIFICANT NOISE
control B0 - 8 bit,10, IGNORE
control B0 - 8 bit,19, check 21-26 visually? *** IGNORE THIS FOLDER COMPLETELY ***
control B0 - 8 bit,27, IGNORE
Control C0 - 8 bit,11, CODE IS RIGHT
Cs-137 04 - 8 bit,49, CODE IS RIGHT
cs137 06 - 8 bit,9, see control 07 - 12 comment
