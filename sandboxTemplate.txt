Code features/wants:

Make original movie
Make movie with filters
make movies with selected frames
make .txt results file with detected image filename, frame number, x, y, time elapsed?, possibly/is invalid (maybe just an "X"?)
frame bar chart and histograms ?? 
time bar chart and histograms ??
location plot w/ scatter and mean + std x,y pos
event heat charts
MAKE IT RUN FASTER
"net" event heat charts need revisiting before being used - methodology with weighting values is difficult - normalization may lead to overvaluing positions from late-frame primary nucleation trials
Replace glob with os methods (i.e. no need for '*' notation which is slower than os.listdir)
Variable frame rate videos (maybe not necessary for all events, this could be computationally taxing)


Know for next time: crop images without rotation and into color - preserve these as the "original versions" and then do whatever with those


NAMING CONVENTIONS:
RUN (i.e. a, e, Run00, run14)
SOURCE (i.e. control0, control1, Cf Pb 2)
TRIAL
PRIMARY NUCLEATION EVENT (+ Frame)
SECONDARY NUCLEATION EVENT(S) (+ Frame)

Background subtractor:

IDEA: FURTHER IMPROVE SELECTION FOR HISTORY BY MAKING IT Length 50 (for example) and then set learning rate to 0 after reaching ballParkFrame - 10 -> 50 frames before detection (might not do anything)

Exception handling - resolve trials with 'X' stamps
Exception handling - detect unusual timestamps, skips/jumps in timestamps, etc.
Exception handling - detect higheer density images (i.e. high framerate)

Comparison of groupings:
common run
common source
compare trials within same folder
common run position comparison (needs to be reviewed to ensure proper handling of mismatched dimensions)
Compare heat maps?

Multiple Scatter Results? - 


dict[run][source][prefix][suffix]

*** Make txt files with the names of all prefixes and then sub txts or sublists of suffixes (avoid glob.glob etc.)
